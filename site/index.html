                <p>11/2014 - 12/2015</p>
                <p>This program is where I was first introduced to <b>iOS</b> development. I started with <b>Objective-C</b>,
                    with which three colleagues and I built an education app for children.
                    Following that project, I started learning Swift. I love it, so I've used it to build most
                    of the apps I've made.</p>
                <p>After that, still at the beginning of the project, I started learning <b>swift</b>.
                    I loved this language, so I used to  make the most apps that I have.</p>
                <p> I also learned the CBL - Challenge Based Learning.
                    You can read more about it <a href="http://www.challengebasedlearning.org/pages/welcome" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

                        So, me and my team decided to do something that represent us: Music, Dance and Creativity.
                    We think about an app that the user could come up with a choreography by moving your arms and then,
                    the opponent will have to mimic your movements as best as he can. </p>
                    <p>This app was made in <b>swift</b>. We used the <b>Core Motion</b> Framework to capture
                        the movements and the <b>Av Foundation Framework</b> for the music.</p>
                    <p>You can download the We Can Move app at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/we-can-move/id1005996193?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>.</p>

                        It is an entertainment app to take pictures and make a timelapse with them. </p>
                    <p>How it works: You create an album, and take some pictures.
                        The app will make for you a timelapse video and then you will be able to store on your iPhone and share with people. </p>

                    <p>I made this app on a 3 day challenge at BEPiD.
                        The theme was free, so I decided to make an app about my candy brand. </p>
                    <p>People can see my history, the candys that I sell and call me through the app.</p>
                    <p>You can download the TuttiDoces app at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/tuttidoces/id992237371?l=en&mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>.</p>

                    <p>How it works: In each level you can see a lot of trash inside the scenario.
                        You have to select each of them and drag to the correct trash can. </p>

                        develop a solution and then validade the solution.</p>
                    <p>Me and my team developed an iOs App in swift called Cerva-se. With it you don`t need wait for a waiter at a restaurante.
                        You can just choose the drink you want, pay with the app and get your drink (beer) with an QRCode. </p>

                    <p>The idea of this app is to schedule surgery. You have to fill up the surgery form and send to the Hospital. </p>
                    <p>We mad this app with swift. We used <b>Core Data</b> and the <b>PostgreSQL</b> Database to send the data to the web server.
                        We used <b>PHP</b> on the server side. </p>

                        The circles are the armies. All the rules were implemented: The first round, each player choose
                        where to put the armies; From the second level, the player can attack order player in order to conquer
                        a territory; The dice were implemented and the territories card too.
